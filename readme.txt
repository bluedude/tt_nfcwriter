Readme

All my projects are created in the same standard way to avoid confusion. Below is s summary:

1. Project instructions
If you need to tweak the project (manifest, package, build configuration) we have instructions included in the 'Project instructions' region of the project.

2. Libs
If a project contains some of our own libs we include them in the subfolder libs.

3. codeAPP module.
For generic variables and app. wide settings I always use a codeAPP module. This is also done for obfuscating purposes.

4. Region names
I try to use region names to make code very easy ro read. In my code you can find things like: 	UI creation, UI View Events etc.

5. List of libraries used
This project uses the following libraries:

-	RSNFCTagWriter v1.00

6. Testing
We have tested this library and project on:

-	Galaxy Nexus, Android 4.3.x
